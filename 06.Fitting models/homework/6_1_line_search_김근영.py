# **Notebook 6.1: Line search**

This notebook investigates how to find the minimum of a 1D function using line search as described in Figure 6.10.

Work through the cells below, running each cell in turn. In various places you will see the words "TO DO". Follow the instructions at these places and make predictions about what is going to happen or write code to complete the functions.

Contact me at udlbookmail@gmail.com if you find any mistakes or have any suggestions.
